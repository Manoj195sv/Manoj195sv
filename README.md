Install nmap on windows and perform basic operations identifying service, open ports, active hosts, operating system, vulnerabilities.
Installing nmap
•	 Open the browser and search ‘nmap download’, open the first website (url:”nmap.org”)
•	Click on window s option and download latest stable release version of nmap for windows.
“nmap-7.95-setup.exe”.
•	Its about 32MB file, after downloading it instrall in your system
To Perform Basic Operation
1.	Open command prompt and type “ipconfig” to get all the IP Addresses of your system.
C:\users\dell\ipconfig
Windows IP Configuration
Ethernet adapter ethernet 3:
IPV4 address…………….: 192.168.56.1

2.	Now copy any IP address from trhere example:
192.168.56.1 and paste that ip address in the target section inside the nmap program or application.

3.	After pasting it to the zenmap application click on scan button
Eg IP Address 192.168.56.1

4.	Wait until it get scanned and you get the below window.

To find open ports and active hosts

After giving this command packet running wire shark open
->it showes welcome to wire shark and select the option etho and after selecting ther will be no packet running
->Then open any browser www.wayne.edu
->after browser displayed www.wayne.edu stop wire shark packet capture by selecting stop in the wireshark capture window
->colour coding- you will probably see packes highlighted in green ,blue brown wireshark user colour to help you to identify the type of trafic at a glays
->you know have line packet data that contais all protocal messeges exchange b/w your camputer and other network entities
->to futher filter packet in wire shark we need to use more precise filter by seting the http.host==www.wayne.edu we are ristricting the view to the pocket that have on http code www.wayne.edu
->now you can try onether protocal that use tcp stream if you right click of any of the packet one list will dispaly in that select and you will get filter stream
->if we clos the window change the filter and back to this one .com select the packe and right click and follow tcp and udp and http stream
